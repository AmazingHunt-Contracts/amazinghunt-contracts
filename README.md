Amazing Hunt is a travel gamification app that turns your sightseeing adventures into exciting quests. By traveling and collecting NFT, you'll discover hidden gems, learn about local culture, and earn rewards. It's the perfect way to make your travels more fun and engaging.

Bored Town partnered with the Tourism Authority of Thailand and Thai NFT artists to launch Amazing Hunt, a map-based app designed to onboard Web2 users to Web3.  By visiting Thai tourist destinations, users could mint NFTs on the Optimism blockchain and earn points redeemable for discounts and vouchers at hotels, restaurants, and businesses nationwide.  From the project's launch at Icon Siam in Bangkok until its conclusion on December 31, 2024, Amazing Hunt successfully onboarded 1,427 users who minted 3,552 NFTs.  Positive feedback from both users and businesses has fueled ongoing development and enhancements to the app, further solidifying Bored Town's commitment to seamless Web3 onboarding through NFT and gamification.  The project's innovative approach has also garnered significant interest from organizations in Thailand and internationally, seeking to leverage Bored Town's technology.
